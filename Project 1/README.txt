Project 1: Exploring Weather Trends

Summary:
In this project, we analyze local and global temperature data and compare the local temperature trends to overall global temperature trends.

Details:
The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where we live. 

To do this, the below steps are followed:

Extract the data from the database. 
Write a SQL query to extract the city level data and global data and export both to CSV.
Use Excel to create a line chart that compares the city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. 
Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages.

The final output is an outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart.
